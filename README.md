# MLR_Emlak_Tahmini (Real Estate Price Prediction)

This project implements a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict real estate prices based on various features. The implementation and analysis can be found in `Emlak_fiyat.ipynb`.

## Model

The project uses Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to analyze and predict real estate prices. MLR is chosen for its ability to handle multiple input features and provide interpretable results in real estate price prediction.

## Files

- `Emlak_fiyat.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis, model implementation, and results
- `multilinearregression.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the model

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn for MLR implementation
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
